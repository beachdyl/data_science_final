## About the Project

In this project, I will be analyzing data from a social experiment where members of an online forum were given the opportunity to increment a running counter by 1 digit. A robot ensured that only the next number in sequence was accepted, so incorrect numbers or illegal/non-numerical entries (essentially all spam) were deleted immediately and do not appear in this data. Users are also not allowed to count multiple numbers in a row (meaning the user that counts the number 108 cannot also count 109). It started at 1 and, as of the time this data was gathered, reached 36597.
Participants were incentivized to participate by being rewarded outside the context of the counting, usually with access to other areas of the forum. Many users were also intrinsically motivated by having access to a running scoreboard where they receive 1 point for each correct number that they count; this created a sense of competition in some people to reach the highest score. In my observations, the participants also self-selected "milestones" that they would try to reach, from small ones such as the next hundred, to large ones such as the next ten thousand. More rare milestones were more desired; the competition for numbers such as 10000, 20000, and 30000 was very harsh, since only the person who sends the number first gets credit for it.
In this project, I explore the trends of how these numbers were counted, fun facts about the numbers and counting patterns, and statistical data of the numbers.
